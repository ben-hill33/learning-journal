# CSS

- The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
## Selector and a Declaration
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box is created.
- A CSS rule contains 2 parts: a **selector** indicates which element the rule applies to, **declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should by syled which are seperated into a property and value.
- **Property** indicates the aspect of the element you want to change and **values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.
## Style Sheets
- Style sheets can be external and internal.
- You will need a link element in your HTML doc to your stylesheet so the style rules apply to the page.
- Unless your site only has one page in it you will want to use an **external** style sheet so that you can link every page you create in your html doc to it. This way you can style similar elements at the same time in creation and maintenance at the same time from the one style sheet.
