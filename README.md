## Growth Mindset

- Growth Mindset to me is a method of learning to where I continuously teach myself to love the process. Enjoy the journey while striving toward the destination.

1. To me this means that I have a fluid approach to the way I choose to learn. I adapt to the unexpected as I learn, not approach what I don't know yet as something I already know.

1. This means to me that I am planting reminders for myself while I am learning to be optimistic even while I'm failing and getting frustrated. When faced with an obstacle I am reminded as I become frustrated that this obstacle is an opportunity to learn how I shouldn't get over that obstacle. 
  
  Before Edison turned on the light he failed again and again and when asked by his peers about these failures,
  
  Edison said,
  > I didn't fail, I just found a thousand ways not to turn on the light.
  
3. This process of approaching something new is remaining optimistic even when I don't understand it.
