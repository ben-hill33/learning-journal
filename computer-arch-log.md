#Computer Architecture and Logic
- There are four elements to a computer that makes it work:
1. Input
1. Storage
1. Processes
1. Output
- A computer's operating system controls how the input is translated to output by **software** called **Binary**
- Binary consists of one's and zero's that are carried through your computers **hardware**
- Hardware is your computers physical components that run electrical signals (binary) which consist of circuits and logically process the information it receives to store the information or carry it to your output so we can see it or both.
