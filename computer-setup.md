### The Difference between Text Editors and IDEs

IDE - Integrated Development Environment is a "suite" of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. IDE's are typically a more advanced tool.

## Command Lines

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
