## Key Concepts
- **Script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
- To write script, you need to state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
- 1. Define the Goal. Think of this as a puzzle for your computer to solve.
- 2.  Design the Script. This step is giving step by step instructions to the computer to achieve your goal.
- 3. Code each step. Use Javascript as a programming language the computer understands. 
- An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
- 1. That just assign a a value to a variable.
- 2. That use two ore more values to return a single value. 
- **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, **you can reuse** the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. As a base rule, a function should do **one thing**.
- When looking at the function name, **you should be able to identify what the function does**.
- Always start a function with lowercase letters.
- Following the name is paranthesis, 
- Followed by curly braces, which is where the logic is stated.
