# Hypertext Markup Language

## Who are websites for?

- When thinking about creating a web page, you need to ask yourself who the website is being built for. If you're building it for you, then do whatever you want to it. If you're building it for someone else, **remember that this is not your website**.
- Every Website should be designed for the **target audience**.
- There are two types of target audiences:
1. Individuals
2. Companies

## Why People Visit your Website

- There are two basic categories of questions you ask:

1. What are the underlying **motivations** for why visitors would come to the site,
1. What would be specific **goals** of the visitors?

## Site Maps

- Create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site, or the **site diagram**.

## Wireframes

- A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key info that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the info and how much space it might require. This involes sketching or shading areas where ach element of the page will go (ie. logo, primary navs, headings and main bodies of text).
- There are online wireframe tools such as [This Wireframe](http://gomockingbird.com), or [This One](http://lovelycharts.com)

# HTML Structure

- Use Headings and subheadings to make your page easier to read. 
- HTML code are made up of content inside angled backets called **elements**. 
- Elements are made up of two tags, opening and closing. 
- **Attributes** provide additional info about the contents of an element and are made up of 2 parts: a name and a value, seperated by an equals sign. The attribute name indicates what kind of extra info you are supplying about the elements conten. The value is the informmation or setting for the attribute. It should be place in double quotes " "

# HTML5 Layout

- HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. 
- Many of the **div** elements have been replaced. For example, the header sits inside a new <header element. 
Navigation sits inside a <nav element, and the articles are in the individual <article elements. 
- **Header** and **footer** elements can be used at the top and bottom of the entire page or within an article or section. These are HTML5 replacements for divs.
- Page length header can be used to contain the site name and the main nav. The footer element contains the copyright.
- Article and section elements use a header for titles and dates, and footers for can contain links to share about the content of the section.
- The **nav** element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site to move around the main page or to different pages within the entire site. It can be used for purposes like links at the bottom of a page such as: (privacy policy, terms and conditions, careers, etc..)
- **Article** elements are basically individual boxes within the content of the body that can contain content seperate or additional side content.
- **Aside** element has two funcstions. If it's inside an article element it might have a pullquote or glossary, if it's used outside of an article, it can be used for content relative to the entire page like links to other parts of the page.
- **Section** elements group related content together such as a few article elements with the same theme. If a page has a long article, section can be used to split it into seperate sections. 
- **Heading Group** elements are used to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so they are treated as one single heading. <hgroup
