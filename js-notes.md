#Javascipt notes
Today we learned how to write a little bit of Javascript into our HTML, CSS, JS project. 
- We did some reading from Duckett's book pages 43-69.
- We played with linking a JS file to our HTML page using this:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Constructive &amp; Co.</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/c01.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Constructive &amp; Co.</h1>
         <script>document.write('<h3>Welcome!</h3>');
        </script> 
        <p>For all orders and inquiries please call
            <em>555-3344</em></p>
    </body>
</html>
```
- The ```<script>``` tag uses Javascript inside an HTML document.
- Best way would be to create a JS document and link it to your index.html
- Javascript is the language that makes a webpage more interactive
